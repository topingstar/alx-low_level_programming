0x18 C - Dynamic librariesÔ∏è
C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. This projects covers dynamic libraries creation and implementation

At the end of this project, I was able to solve this questions:

What is a dynamic library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it
What is the environment variable $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and how to use it
What are the differences between static and shared libraries
Basic usage nm, ldd, ldconfig
